# Viz
 
 ## About
 This project was created for the GoldenHack, a business hackathon, hosted at Wilfried Laurier University.
 ### What It Does
 Viz is a platform that allows users to better visualize the financial situation of any company by converting their balance sheets and income statements into various diagrams.
 Viz also allows users to upload their own financial documents to convert them into visuals as well.
 By using a commenting and voting system, users can see others' opinions on a company's situation and compare it to that of expert's feedback.
 
 ### Front End
 The front end of the web app was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and is responsible for displaying the graphs and images.
 
 ### Back End
 The back end of the web app runs on Flask, and the main functionality is in Python in order to scrape spreadsheets, and convert to graphs using the Plotly library.
